# Katip Datadog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip)

katip-datadog is a scribe for the Katip logging framework that sends
structured logs to the Datadog logging service. It supports both
directly sending to the ingestion API and through a locally installed
datadog agent.
